			<div><strong>About Myself:</strong></div>
			<p>
				As indicated in my resume, I once pursued a career in aviation. I received my commercial pilotâ€™s license from Algonquin Flight Center along with other ratings and licenses. I have also gained valuable work experience from my employment with Transwest Air, a small airline that operates in Saskatchewan. This experience includes micro-management, dispatching, billing, computer and multiple ground handling skills. After being laid off, due to lack of work within this company, I decided to enroll at Carleton University for computer science. Although I still have an interest in aviation, my future at this time is focused in the field of computer science.
			</p>
			<p>
				In January 2015, I graduated from Carleton University with a bachelor's degree in computer science. My chosen stream at Carleton was called mobile and social networking applications. During my time at Carleton I had three co-op placements. My first co-op placement was for 8-months at Public Works Government Services. Here I gained experience in web and mobile phone development. My second co-op placement was at The Ottawa Hospital for 4-months. Here I continued to develop my SQL and web development skills. My last co-op position was at HCN (Hotel Communication Network Inc.) as an Android developer. After graduation, I continued to work full-time with HCN for two years. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In February 2017, I joined Paradigm Electronics Inc. Paradigm is a company that specializes in high-end audio products. I am currently still employed with this company as an application developer for desktop, web, Android and iOS platforms.
